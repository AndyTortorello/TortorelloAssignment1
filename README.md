1. Framebuffer can hold multiple buffers which carry different information. For example, a buffer to store depth information for processing and creating images from 3D data. (p. 6 )

However, if you have to process results from the same data multiple times, having multiple boxes can help increase the speed of processing. As a result, there is a balancing act to get the most efficent pipeline while having the fewest number boxes or components in it. (p. 30)
